                           <h2>Anh</h2>
                            <p>

                             Anh has never entered a lottery but she has won the lottery of family, of dating and of (future) in-laws. Unmoved since youth by traditional celebrity archetypes, Anh’s heroes are the two extraordinary ordinary people she is proud to call “Mom” and “Dad”. She is deeply grateful to her parents for their unconditional love and support and for a gift of a big sister who has been her best friend and will be her maid of honor. She has a brother-in-law who feels more like a brother to her and an adorable niece who has captured Anh’s heart the moment she was born. Together, they’ve built such a happy home that whenever Anh comes back to Vietnam, she realizes how lucky she is to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard. She is also thankful to have friends who have always been there for her and who bring out the best in her. Ever since she was a little girl, Anh knew exactly what she wanted in a future boyfriend. He must be an avid reader who is smart and funny, patient and kind, great with kids, gets along well with her family and loves her no matter what. When all of those desirable traits came in a (very) tall and handsome package named David Kearney, Anh felt like she had hit the jackpot! When she met David's family and extend family, Anh was touched by their kindness and warmth. She is very blessed to have such wonderful people in her life and can't wait to see you all in May!

                              

                             <!--When she met David’s family and extended family, she was touched by their warmth and kindness. and felt like she had hit the double jackpot! Anh was more impressed about David’s great sense of humour than about his staggering height (6'6''/198cm!).-->

                                   Born in Des Moines, Iowa, with tall man disease, David put lots of effort into living in places around the world where he would be as physically uncomfortable as possible. From Japan, to China to Vietnam, David made sure to smash his head into any door frame or ceiling that looked at him the wrong way. Defying all expectations, after a seemly endless series of self inflicted head wounds, David was considered to possess enough remaining brain cells to complete a PhD at Duke University, where he would join his brother and cross paths on Day 1 with Anh Do, who would change his life forever. He is indebted to his parents for their support in countless ways, for cultivating his creativity and humor and putting up with him in general. He is grateful to his brother for becoming the kind of doctor that helps people, so he can feel better about becoming the kind of doctor that does not help people. He is thankful for the support of his friends throughout the fun and challenges of life because 'without friends no one would choose to live, though he had all other goods' (NE). David is further deeply indebted for Anh’s family being unfailingly and unreasonably kind and supportive throughout his time in Vietnam. They also bought him the suit prominently featured in this wedding!  </p>

                            <p>Our story began in Gross Hall 270 at Duke University on the first day of our PhD program orientation. We walked home together everyday, we became good friends and later became inseparable. Our relationship was deepened by common values (family) and by common adversity (graduate school). Traveling together all over the planet and back home (Vietnam and Iowa), we found it much easier to take on the world as a team.</p>

                                Duke Gardens is a 55-acre public botanic garden on the campus of Duke University. It is a place of beauty, dedicated to learning, inspiration and enjoyment. The gardens has meant a lot to us over our years at Duke, and we hope you will see why we think it is so special in May. To give you a sense of what the gardens are like, please consult the background picture of this page!

Since that time, Sarah P. Duke Gardens has developed dramatically and beautifully. It now features four distinct areas: the original Terraces and their immediate surroundings, known as the Historic Gardens, including the Mary Duke Biddle Rose Garden and historic Roney Fountain; the H.L. Blomquist Garden of Native Plants, a representation of the flora of the southeastern United States; the W.L. Culberson Asiatic Arboretum, devoted to plants of eastern Asia; and the Doris Duke Center Gardens, including the new Charlotte Brody Discovery Garden. &nbsp;&nbsp; Go <a href="https://gardens.duke.edu/about" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://gardens.duke.edu/visit" target="_blank">here</a> for more information.
